### Description
This program is the only program that 4303X is using this year. There are a few disadvantages to this, but they are quickly out weighed by the advantages. The autonomous selector is one of the many things that will make this file format much easier than having multiple repositories.

### Autons
We have a lot of autons planned for this year. We are only likely to use four in matches. Two for elimination matches and two for qualification matches. The goal of the qual autons are to get the AWP, and the goal of the elim autons are to get as many points as possible while preventing the enemy alliance from getting as many themselves.

### User Control
We use a tank drive with 6 motors, 2 of which are PTO motors. We also have a catapult, an intake, wings, and an end game. The catapult and intake receive 1 motor each, and the end game uses the 2 PTO motors. The PTO should only be activated during the AWP auton and at the end of the game. The wings are controlled by pistons, allowing for single button activation/deactivation.
